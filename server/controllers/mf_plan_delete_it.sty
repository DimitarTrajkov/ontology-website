good but i would like the following structure:


1. table containing:

"RAW_instances"
"RAW_features"

"PREPROCESSED_proportion duplicate features"
"PREPROCESSED_proportion duplicate rows"



2. pie chart where binary is inside numerical.
constant can be writed under the pie chart

"RAW_number numeric features"
"RAW_number binary features"

3. pie chart for PP. binary is part of numerical
"PREPROCESSED_number numeric features"
"PREPROCESSED_number binary features"


4. box like plot 
"RAW_min class frequency"
